I call myself an _Effectivity & Efficiency Enthusiast_, always trying to find the most convenient but flexible way with the best possible result, especially in a long-term view.****I have worked in, with and for the internet for over fifteen years, and thus I know that the internet is much more than websites and more than software development.

Finding ways and solutions for the new challenges arising, having so many touch points in every area of our lives, that's what drives my motivation. Not only from a user's perspective, but also from a creator's point of view.
